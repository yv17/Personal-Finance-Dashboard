# Personal-Finance-Dashboard

Hello there, if you land on here, I assume you viewed my CV and thanks for visiting!

I am passionate about all things data & BI. As I work with business stakeholders mostly, I think it will be fun to create a dashboard for myself, to see how would I cater to my very own requirements and how they evolve over time.

Hence, I am documenting my journey here in iterating my Power BI dashboard to track my personal finance, which I will update from time to time.
